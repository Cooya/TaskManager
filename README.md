```javascript
const { TaskManager, Task } = require('@coya/task-manager');

const firstTask = new Task('firstTask', 10, function() {
    console.log('hello');
    return Promise.resolve();
});

const secondTask = new Task('secondTask', 5, function() {
    console.log('hola');
    return Promise.resolve();
});

const thirdTask = new Task('thirdTask', 2, function() {
    console.log('failure');
    return Promise.reject();
});

const taskManager = new TaskManager();
taskManager.onTaskEnd(function(task) {
    console.log('The task "' + task.name + '" has been removed from the task manager.');

```

## Methods


### processSynchronousTasks(taskList)

Process tasks list successively, it means that tasks are executed one by one. The following task is executed once the previous one is done.

Parameter | Type    | Description | Default value
--------  | ---     | --- | ---
taskList  | array<Task> | list of objects implementing or inheriting the Task class | none

### processAsynchronousTasks(taskList)

Process tasks list simultaneously, it means that tasks are executed in the same time (using setTimeout()). It is different from setInterval() because the timer is launched after the task has been processed.

Parameter | Type    | Description | Default value
--------  | ---     | --- | ---
taskList  | array<Task> | list of objects implementing or inheriting the Task class | none

### Task spec

The Task class, and so its constructor, contains three fields :
* name => name of the task
* timeInterval => interval in seconds between each task execution
* maxFailuresInARow (optional) => determine the number of failures in a row before the task will be taken out of the task list (default it is 5) 
* run => task function called by the scheduler, it must return a promise (this function can be passed to the Task constructor or be a member method of the inheriting class)
